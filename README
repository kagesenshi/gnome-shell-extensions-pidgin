Gnome Shell Pidgin extension
by KageSenshi

The extension utilize pidgin's dbus API, to intergrate Pidgin into the Gnome
shell. I only did some rough test with it only on my Fedora 15 machine, but
I believe it should work ok everywhere else.

Install:
 mkdir -p ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/pidgin@gnome-shell-extensions.gnome.org
 cp extension.js metadata.json ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/pidgin@gnome-shell-extensions.gnome.org

 and then restart Gnome shell (Alt+F2 type r and hit enter)
